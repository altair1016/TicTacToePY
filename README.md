# TicTacToePY
Refers to a personal python Project in which I developed a python TicTacToe with grafics and computer logics to play against.
Inside code you can change the AI level. From easy to very hard. Try to beat it! 
***_Please, use my code, but also reference my repository. This will be appreciated as an offered beer! :P_***
